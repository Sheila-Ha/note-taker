THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column  
WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text  
THEN a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page  
WHEN I click on the Save button  
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear
